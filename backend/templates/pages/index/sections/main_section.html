                <p>We are Irina and Petr. We started the Territory of Good shelter more than 10 years ago in Kharkiv, Ukraine.</p>
                <p>When the war started, we were forced to leave, so we came to Poti, Georgia, bringing those dogs we could save from the war. For the last year and a half we've been living here, trying to save as many stray animals from the streets as possible. Especially those who clearly wouldn't survive: injured, old, small ones. We have 41 dogs and two cats now. Some of them are recovering from abuse or illness, while others are ready to be adopted.</p>
                <p>Eventually, people started bringing dogs to us here too. We can't refuse to help but our abilities are limited as it's only two of us.</p>
                <p>If you want to adopt, you are more than welcome. Some of the dogs already had their luck finding new loving families in various European countries.</p>
                <p>Petr works as a construction worker and Irina takes care of the shelter full time. We aren't funded, so if you want to donate, please do.</p>
