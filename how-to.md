# How to contribute

Steps to contribute:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/qase-tms/shelterpaws/`
	- If you work on the meta-site (https://qase-tms.github.io/shelterpaws/), switch to `gh-pages` branch: `git checkout gh-pages`
	- If you work on the product, stay in main branch.

2. Visit the [issues page](https://github.com/qase-tms/shelterpaws/issues) and choose the issue to work on.

3. Edit the markdown file you want, save your edits.

4. Run `git add your_file.md`, commit and [create pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Do not forget to add an issue number you were working on in the commit message like so: `git commit -m "#4 some text"` where '4' is your issue number from the [issues page](https://github.com/qase-tms/shelterpaws/issues).

Please note we use [TBD](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com), so all the work on the shelterpaws system is done in main branch and all the work on the meta-system is done in gh-pages branch.
