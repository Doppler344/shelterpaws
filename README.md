# Shelterpaws

A system for animal shelters, providing an easy and free way for shelter owners to display their pets, help them find new homes, and fundraise.

**Why:**

1. Sheltered animals want new homes
2. Shelter owners want to:
    - display the animals
    - fundraise
    - communicate with potential new owners
