A system for animal shelters, providing an easy and free way for shelter owners to display their pets, help them find new homes, and fundraise.

## Why

1. Sheltered animals want new homes
2. Shelter owners want to:
    - show the animals to potential adopters
    - fundraise to help the shelter survive
